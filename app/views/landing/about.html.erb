    About ARC - African Ruby Community
  </h1>

  <p class="pt-12 text-justify">
    African Ruby Community, ARC, is an organization that was started in 2010.
    The community currently has a reach of over 5,000 members spread across East Africa,
    made up of developers (engineers), entrepreneurs, designers, and freelancers.
    In terms of development and demonstrations, the community focuses on Ruby technologies and frameworks,
    which are all open source and widely used by startups to prototype and carry out proof of concept with a go-to-market strategy.
  </p>

  <p class="pt-10 text-justify">
    The community hosts weekly and monthly meetups in different cities in East Africa.
    The community brings you Ruby Conference every year with different themes to fill the gap
    that exists between school and industry and in return helps spur innovation and growth in
    contribution to the global economy.
  </p>

  <p class="pt-10 text-justify">
    ARC brings entrepreneurs, developers, designers, and open source contributors.
    Why? We believe in a holistic approach; through entrepreneurship, a “solution approach,”
    and open source, we can solve so many problems. This in return empowers everyone who
    attends with technology “tools” and entrepreneurship “methodology” to reach their fullest
    potential and inspire the rest of the world and their communities.
